  /// which either points to a real Gazebo Joint object, or is left NULL.
  /// When controller calls an equivalent Gazebo Joint API using this
  /// JointHelper class, it either passes them through to the Gazebo
  /// Joint class for valid Gazebo Joints, or get/set the local values
  /// for the "fake" joint.
  /// A pesudo-code example below:
  ///
  /// ~~~
  /// HaptixGazeboJointHelper realJoint;
  /// realJoint.SetJoint(realGazeboJointPtr);
  /// HaptixGazeboJointHelper noJoint;
  /// realJoint.GetPosition(0);  // effectively calls realJoint->GetPosition(0)
  /// noJoint.SetPosition(10);  // sets noJoint.fakeJoint to 10
  /// noJoint.GetPosition(0);  // returns noJoint.fakeJoint
  /// ~~~
  ///
  /// The reason for creating this class is that we've created artificial
  /// motor joints which do not exist in the Gazebo model for the arm
  /// (e.g. `indexm`, `middlem`, `ringm` and `pinkym`), but we want to
  /// manipulate these *fake joints*, in a transparent way similar to
  /// the real joints.
